## Decentralized, lightweight, and good for single-user microblogging platform.

ActorsCafé is a microblogging web application. This implements ActivityPub, so you can connect with other ActivityPub servers (e.g. ActorsCafé, Mastodon, Misskey, Pleroma.)

You can post your opinions, repost other users' one, and react them by using Emoji 🙃
