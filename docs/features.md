# Features of ActorsCaf√©

ActorsCaf√© provides you a comfortable place to join the Fediverse community. Your account is for your own self-expression. You don't have to follow specific community rules.

## Post

Express your thoughts with a maximum of 1000 characters (changeable by the administrator). If necessary, you can also add a CW (Content Warning) to the post to attach a note.

You can attach your files to post and express more deeply with emoji. By specifying the visibility, you can hide it from people who don't follow you.

Post will appear on your profile page and the timeline of people who follow you.

## Repost

If the post on the timeline is a good one, let's repost it. Repost will appear on your profile page and follower timeline. In ActorsCaf√©, a comment of at least one letter is required to avoid arbitrary impression manipulation by reposting. Repost will be notified to the author of the post.

## Reaction

Reaction is a good way to tell your feelings to posted user. Post can be reacted with a single emoji. If you think the post is good, give üëç. If the user says they want to eat hamburgers, give üçî. Reaction will be notified to the author of the post.

## Reply / Mention

If you want to tell Post more in detail, send a reply. Replies are notified to the post author. A reply is a new Post that hangs on that Post.

You can also mention the user by sending the user name starting with @, such as "@UserName". Mentions are posted to the post author.

## Follow

If you like users, follow them. When you follow, you will see posts from people you follow on your timeline. I'd like them to follow you back.

## Recommendation

Not sure who to follow after you just started? The recommendedation feature will introduce you to recommended users.

## Profile Editor

The internet is an anonymous place. Most users don't know your face or name. Your profile is your virtual face on the Internet. Set your name, avatar image and self-introduction. However, you shouldn't write your real name or real face photo.
